### Description

What's smaller than a Feather but larger than a Trinket? It's an Adafruit ItsyBitsy ESP32, a powerful processor PCB with a plethora of pins! It features the ESP32 Pico module, an FCC-certified module that contains an ESP32 chip with dual-core 240MHz Tensilica processor, WiFi, and Bluetooth classic + BLE, configured with 8 MB of Flash memory, and 2 MB of PSRAM.

We've added some handy accessories like a USB to serial converter chip, power regulator, USB Micro B, buttons, NeoPixel, and Stemma QT I2C connector to outfit this super-hero chip for any task you want to throw it at. This is also an ultra low power ESP32 board with a deep sleep current consumption of 10uA!

At the core of the Itsy is the ESP32 (PICO ECO V3) chip, which is a single 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combo chip designed with TSMCâ€™s 40 nm low-power technology. The ESP32 PICO in particular integrates all peripheral components seamlessly, including a crystal oscillator, flash, PSRAM, filter capacitors, and RF matching links in one single package. This makes it perfect for stuffing into a small space as the ItsyBitsy.

Please note, like other ESP32 modules, the ItsyBitsy ESP32 does not have native USB support - instead, there's a USB to serial converter chip. This means it cannot act like a USB keyboard or mouse, but it does have BLE and BT classic, so you could use it wirelessly.

Here are some of the updates you can look forward to when using ItsyBitsy ESP32:

* Same size, form-factor as the remaining ItsyBitsy mainboards - with a similar but not identical pinout (there are no pins at the end of the board like most other Itsy's due to the radio antenna being there)
* USB Micro B - To maintain compatibility with the rest of the ItsyBitsy's
* ESP32 V2 03 Dual Core 240MHz Xtensa processor - the ESP32 you know and love, with the latest engineering fixes. Massive user base and thousands of existing projects and libraries to use.
* WiFi, Bluetooth LE, and BT Classic for any IoT project usage
* 8 MB Flash & 2 MB PSRAM
* USB to Serial converter built-in with high-speed UART for debugging and uploading, auto-reset circuit works perfectly with any ESP32 uploading tool.
* Can be used with Arduino IDE, CircuitPython or MicroPython
* Built-in RGB NeoPixel LED with power control to reduce quiescent power in deep sleep
* Built-in Red LED on pin D13
* 5V level-shifted output on D5, perfect for driving NeoPixels or other devices that want 5V logic signal
* Battery input pads on the underside with diode protection for external battery packs up to 6V input
* 20 General Purpose "IO" pins:
	* 20 Pads expose pins from the ESP32:
	* 3 are analog input only (A3, A4, A5)
	* 1 is digital output only (5) with 5V level shifted up
	* 13 x 12-bit analog inputs (A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, D12, D13, D14, SDA, SCL, D32, D33)
	* Dual 8-bit analog output DACs on A0/A1
	* PWM outputs on any pin
	* I2C port with STEMMA QT plug-n-play connector - a second I2C port can be defined on any other pins.
	* Hardware UART in addition to the USB-serial UART
	* Hardware SPI on the high speed SPI peripheral pins - a second SPI port can be defined on any other pins.
	* Hardware I2S on any pins
	* 8 x Capacitive Touch with no additional components required
* 3.3V regulator with 600mA peak output
* Light sleep at 4mA, deep sleep at ~10uA
* Reset switch for starting your project code over, for entering bootloader mode or for user reading
* User switch on pin 35
* Really small

Each order comes with one assembled and tested ItsyBitsy ESP32 with headers that can be soldered in for use with a breadboard.
